Through our initial assignment, my programming skills have experienced significant growth, providing me with a foundational understanding of HTML, JS, and CSS for website development. While I currently rely on some assistance, I recognize the need to enhance my skills by coding from memory, without external support.

The class's WODs and Labs throughout the semester have been instrumental, offering me valuable insights into the fundamental concepts necessary for website creation. Assignment 1, though challenging, served as a pivotal learning experience. Building an ecommerce website independently prompted extensive research, contributing to my readiness for Assignment 2 and the inevitable challenges it presents.

I suggest improving the class by introducing collaborative group activities, fostering a supportive environment where students can pool their knowledge. This approach could benefit those struggling by providing assistance within the group dynamic.

The instructional videos posted by Sal have proven immensely helpful, breaking down intricate code details. Additionally, the group session for Assignment 1 facilitated a collaborative learning atmosphere that I believe significantly contributed to my understanding.
