  <h3 id="intro-to-the-wod">Intro to the WOD</h3>

<p>SmartPhoneProducts1 with variables was a WOD that focused on the creation of variables. These variables included names, prices, and links to the smart phone images on our web page. The WOD also focused on eliminating hard coding and separating the javascript into a different file.</p>

<p>The instructions and details for WOD 5.1, can be found <a href="https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/morea/050.variables_data_types/experience-SmartPhoneProducts1_variables.html">here.</a></p>

<h3 id="my-experience-what-went-well">My Experience, What Went Well</h3>

<p>Performing the WOD was fairly easy. I felt this WOD was very straightforward and that it was simply doing something we already learned in a different way incorporating an outside javascript file to create the exact same result. Something that I used for this WOD that worked well was RegEx. I was able to incorporate into my WOD so that I did not have to manually do things. It saved a lot of time and overall made me perform my WOD faster and more efficiently.</p>

<h3 id="what-i-did-to-prepare-things-i-should-have-done-differently">What I Did To Prepare. Things I Should Have Done Differently</h3>

<p>To prepare for this WOD, I made sure to read and watch all the material and resources provided the following days. I also took notes on the comments that our professor made during class that drastically helped me through the process of this WOD. There is nothing that I believe I should have done differently because I had completed this WOD smoothly. Something that I have been doing throughout my WODS are preparing for the screencast before starting it and talking with peers to get different perspectives.</p>
