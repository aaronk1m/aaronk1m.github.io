  <h2 id="browser-history-1">Browser History 1</h2>
<p>Browser History 1 focused on creating a functional website that had images, headings, paragraphs, lists, and links.</p>

<p>This WOD was the most challenging for me because I never had to code and problem solve while explaining what I am doing. Remembering the different functions, commands, and tags to write my code off the top of my head was also a challenge because the other assignments prior, for the most part, we were copying from the lecture slides, the professor, or the assignment resources. To obtain the information, retain in, and put it into use was a new challenge for me. Also, the first screen capture attempt for me, my mic did not record on my recording software so I was forced to record my WOD again. Although this was frustrating, it helped reinforce and instill the ideas in me.</p>

<p>Advice I have is to carefully read every line of the instructions and set a plan for yourself before you hit record. You want to get a basic idea of what you are going to do and how to do it before you actually start doing it.</p>

<h2 id="browser-history-2">Browser History 2</h2>
<p>Browser History 2 was about CSS and the styling of our HTML code for our webpage.</p>

<p>This WOD was one of the easier ones of the three. I found it very interesting to personalize and style the HTML code so retaining the information on how to do so was simple. Before my screen capture attempt, I studied the different CSS commands, and did the screen capture attempt in one try.</p>

<p>My advice is to once again, read the instructions extremely carefully and study the CSS commands.</p>

<h2 id="browser-history-3">Browser History 3</h2>
<p>Browser History 3 focused on the formatting of columns, sections, and making margins.</p>

<p>This WOD was specifically challenging for me because I had never had prior experience on using inspect elements on a web page. When understanding and planning how to do the code before my screen capture attempt, I had to focus a lot of attention on the navigation bar portion of the instructions because I kept running into errors. After figuring it out, I was able to complete my screen capture attempt in one try.</p>

<p>For this WOD, my advice is to very carefully read the instructions and run through the code before you start recording. You may also have to do quite a bit of trial and error for the font and the margins to appear how you want them to.</p>
